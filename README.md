**Human-Like Grasp Synthesis (Ongoing | 2025.03 ‚Äì Present)**  

This repository contains my semester project at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), built on top of BODex.
The goal of this project is to explore Human-like Robotic Dexterous Grasp Synthesis using BODex‚Äôs efficient GPU-based pipeline.
Specifically, I extend the original framework to generate grasp poses that mimic common human strategies, such as two-finger pinch, three-finger tripod, and five-finger hook, lumbrical, and spherical grasps.

üîß This project is under active development, and mainly focuses on learning, prototyping, and validating task-oriented grasp synthesis approaches inspired by the way humans grasp objects.

üîç Method Extension
To better capture the characteristics of human grasping, I introduce joint-level constraints and energy terms based on:

Joint Consistency energy: to ensure that finger joints within a group move in a coordinated way, supporting poses like hook and lumbrical grasps.

Joint Bending Energy: to encourage natural finger flexion patterns aligned with specific human grasp types.

These customized energy components guide the optimization towards more structured and human-like grasp poses while maintaining stability and force closure.

# DexGraspBench

A standard and unified simulation benchmark in [MuJoCo](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco/) for dexterous grasping, aimed at **enabling a fair comparison across different grasp synthesis methods**, proposed in *BODex: Scalable and Efficient Robotic Dexterous Grasp Synthesis Using Bilevel Optimization [ICRA 2025]*.

[Project page](https://pku-epic.github.io/BODex/) ｜ [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16490) | [Grasp synthesis code](https://github.com/JYChen18/BODex)

## Introduction

### Main Usage
- Replay and test **open-loop** grasping poses/trajectories in parallel.

- Each grasping data point only needs to include:
  - Object (must be pre-processed by [MeshProcess](https://github.com/JYChen18/MeshProcess)): `obj_scale`, `obj_pose`, `obj_path`.
  - Hand: `approach_qpos` (optional), `pregrasp_qpos`, `grasp_qpos`, `squeeze_qpos`.

- For a quick start, some example data is provided in the `output/example_shadow` directory, which can be directly evaluated with the following line after [installing](https://github.com/JYChen18/DexGraspBench/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
```
bash script/example.sh
```

### Highlight

- **Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics**: Includes simulation success rate, analytic force closure metrics, penetration depth, contact quality, data diversity, and more.
- **Diverse Experimental Settings**: Covers various robotic hands (e.g., Allegro, Shadow, Leap, UR10e+Shadow), data formats (e.g., motion sequences, static poses), and scenarios (e.g., tabletop lifting, force-closure testing).
- **Multiple Baseline Methods**: Includes optimization-based grasp synthesis approaches (e.g., [DexGraspNet](https://github.com/PKU-EPIC/DexGraspNet), [FRoGGeR](https://github.com/alberthli/frogger), [SpringGrasp](https://github.com/Stanford-TML/SpringGrasp_release), [BODex](https://pku-epic.github.io/BODex/)) and data-driven baselines (e.g., CVAE, Diffusion Model, Normalizing Flow).
- **Reproducible and Standardized Testing**: The hand assets are sourced from [MuJoCo_Menagerie](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_menagerie), with modification details provided in the `assets/hand` directory. 

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone the third-party library [MuJoCo Menagerie](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_menagerie).
```
git submodule update --init --recursive --progress
```
2. Install the python environment via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). 
```
conda create -n DGBench python=3.10 
conda activate DGBench
pip install numpy==1.26.4
conda install pytorch==2.2.2 pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia 
pip install mujoco
pip install trimesh
pip install hydra-core
pip install transforms3d
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
pip install usd-core
pip install imageio
pip install 'qpsolvers[clarabel]'
```

### Running
1. (Optional) Download our pre-processed object assets `DGN_obj_processed.zip` and `DGN_obj_split.zip` from [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/JiayiChenPKU/BODex) and organize the unzipped folders as below. Alternatively, new object assets can be pre-processed using [MeshProcess](https://github.com/JYChen18/MeshProcess).
```
assets/object/DGN_obj
|- processed_data
|  |- core_bottle_1a7ba1f4c892e2da30711cdbdbc73924
|  |_ ...
|- valid_split
|  |- all.json
|  |_ ...
```

2. (Optional) Synthesize new grasp data with [BODex](https://github.com/JYChen18/BODex) and convert to our supported format. There are also some all-in-one scripts in the `script` directory to test BODex's grasps.
```
python src/main.py task=format task.data_path=${YOUR_PATH_TO_BODEX_OUTPUT}
```

3. Evaluate synthesized grasps. 
```
python src/main.py task=eval
```

4. Calculate statistics after evaluation.
```
python src/main.py task=stat
```

### Visualization
We provide two methods to visualize the synthesized grasps. The first method is through [OpenUSD](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenUSD). 
```
python src/main.py task=vusd
```
The other method is to save OBJ files.
```
python src/main.py task=vobj
```

## Changelog
The `main` branch serves as our standard benchmark, with some adjustments to the settings compared to the [BODex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16490) paper, aimed at improving the practicality. Key changes include increasing the object mass from 30g to 100g, raising the hand's kp from 1 to 5, and supporting more diverse object assets. One can further reduce friction coefficients `miu_coef` (currently 0.6 for tangential and 0.02 for torsional) to increase difficulty.

The original benchmark version is available in the `baseline` branch. This branch also includes code to test other grasp synthesis baselines, such as [DexGraspNet](https://github.com/PKU-EPIC/DexGraspNet), [FRoGGeR](https://github.com/alberthli/frogger), [SpringGrasp](https://github.com/Stanford-TML/SpringGrasp_release).


### Future Plan
- Incorporate visual/tactile feedback to support **close-loop** evaluation.
- Add support for other physics simulators, such as [MJX](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mjx.html) and the [IPC-based simulator](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3528223.3530064).

The detailed updating timeline is unclear.

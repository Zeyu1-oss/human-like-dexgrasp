**Human-Like Grasp Synthesis (Ongoing | 2025.03 ‚Äì Present)**

This repository contains my semester project at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), built on top of BODex. The goal of this project is to explore Human-like Robotic Dexterous Grasp Synthesis using BODex‚Äôs efficient GPU-based pipeline. Specifically, I extend the original framework to generate grasp poses that mimic common human strategies, such as two-finger pinch, three-finger tripod, and five-finger hook, lumbrical, and spherical grasps.

 **Project Focus**
This project is under active development, primarily emphasizing the learning, prototyping, and validation of task-oriented grasp synthesis methods inspired by human grasping behaviors.

 **Energy Extensions**
To better replicate human grasp characteristics, I introduce joint-level constraints and energy terms:

* **Joint Consistency Energy:** Ensures coordinated finger joint movements within a group, facilitating realistic poses like hook and lumbrical grasps.
* **Joint Bending Energy:** Promotes natural finger flexion patterns aligned with specific human grasp types.

These customized energy components guide optimization toward structured, stable, and human-like grasp poses that maintain force closure.

**Final Goal**
Ultimately, the aim is to generate a large-scale, high-quality grasp dataset based on different human-like grasp types to support future research on data-driven robotic grasping methods.
